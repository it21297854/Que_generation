        "Question": "Explain the concept of Sentence Stress and its importance in English communication.",
        "Answer": "Sentence Stress refers to the emphasis placed on certain words within a sentence to convey meaning. In English, not all words are stressed equally; typically, the key words that carry the main meaning of the sentence are stressed, while less important words are not. Understanding Sentence Stress is crucial for both speaking and listening, as it helps in understanding the speaker's intent and makes communication more effective."

Revision should be done systematically: first after one day, then after one week, and finally after one month. This repeated exposure helps reinforce the knowledge and makes it easier to recall."
