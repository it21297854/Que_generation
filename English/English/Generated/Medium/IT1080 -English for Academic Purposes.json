        "Question": "Describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food supply chains in Sri Lanka.",
        "Answer": "The pandemic led to labor shortages in crop cultivation and food supply chain activities due to mobility restrictions. This caused disruptions in food manufacturing processes and increased post-harvest losses, particularly for perishable goods. These supply chain issues drove up food prices, affecting vulnerable populations."
