        "Question": "Explain how InsAR technology helps in monitoring volcanic activity.",
        "Answer": "InsAR technology helps in monitoring volcanic activity by detecting slight deformations in the ground caused by movements of molten rock beneath the surface. It uses satellite radar images to create interferograms, which show the direction and extent of ground deformation, providing valuable data for assessing volcanic unrest."
